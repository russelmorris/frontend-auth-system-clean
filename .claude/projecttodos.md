## ðŸ”´ CRITICAL ISSUE: Admin Whitelist Page Not Working

**Main Problem**: The `/admin/whitelist` page keeps bouncing back to the dashboard landing page instead of displaying the whitelist management interface.

## Current Bugs

### 1. Admin Whitelist Page Redirect Loop (PRIORITY)
- **Issue**: When navigating to `/admin/whitelist`, page redirects back to `/dashboard`
- **Impact**: Cannot manage email whitelist through web interface
- **Attempted Solutions**:
  - Updated middleware configuration to protect `/admin/*` routes
  - Modified session handling in `app/admin/whitelist/page.tsx`
  - Changed from Next.js redirect() to window.location.href
  - Added issuer configuration to fix OAuth errors
- **Status**: UNRESOLVED

### Investigation Needed
- Check if session is properly available in admin page
- Verify admin email check logic is working
- Debug middleware matcher patterns
- Test without middleware protection temporarily
- Check console/network logs for redirect triggers

## Working Features
- âœ… Basic authentication with Microsoft accounts
- âœ… Dashboard access after sign-in
- âœ… Email whitelist checking during sign-in
- âœ… Support for both personal and work accounts

## Next Steps
1. **FIX WHITELIST PAGE REDIRECT** (Critical)
2. Test authentication flow end-to-end
3. Deploy to Vercel once whitelist page works
4. Add production URLs to Azure app registration

## Completed Tasks
- âœ… Implemented Azure AD authentication
- âœ… Fixed OAuth callback errors (issuer mismatch)
- âœ… Created whitelist.json system
- âœ… Built admin interface (but has redirect issue)
- âœ… Updated middleware configuration
